## 2. Visual Identity in Words
Overall, the visual identity is neutral, classic and minimalist, with earthy warmth and rich, carefully placed accent colors.

*   **Linen** provides a calm, inviting light-grey base, often used as a warmer alternative to stark white for backgrounds and UI surfaces.
*   **Taupe** and **Rust** form the main brand color pair, bringing warmth and an earthy sophistication to backgrounds, headers and key accents.
*   **Charcoal** introduces a deep, classy contrast, ideal for primary text and occasional dramatic backgrounds when used with restraint.
*   **Ruby**, **Navy** and **Forest** are secondary accent colors, used sparingly to add richness and depth without overwhelming the neutral foundation.

Layouts should feel spacious and uncluttered, with ample breathing room around the crane logo and key content, echoing the lake’s tranquility. The crane symbol and its applications should feel elegant and serene, never busy or visually noisy, reinforcing a sense of quiet luxury. Typography combines the classic elegance of Plantin MT Pro with the clean modernity of Work Sans, creating a refined yet approachable look.

## 3. Logo and Icon Usage Guidance
The primary logo features a majestic crane that symbolizes tranquility, beauty, strength and longevity, authentic to Smith Mountain Lake and the brand’s long-term commitment to guests.

*   Always render the logo or icon in a **single solid brand color**; avoid multi-colored treatments that make the design feel cluttered.
*   Primary colors should be preferred for the logo; secondary colors may be used with discretion when design needs require more variety.
*   **Approved color combinations** for the logo include Charcoal on white, Charcoal on Linen, Charcoal on Taupe, Taupe on white, Linen on Rust, Linen on Charcoal, and Rust on white.
*   Additional approved treatments include White on Ruby, Ruby on white, White on Navy, Navy on white, White on Forest and Forest on white.
*   The logo may appear directly on imagery only when it remains clearly visible and the overall composition stays sophisticated and elegant.
*   Maintain minimum breathing space around the logo equal to the **height of the wordmark** on all sides; no text or other elements may intrude into this zone.
*   The icon (crane mark alone) follows the same color and clarity rules but uses a minimum breathing space equal to **half the height of the icon**.
*   Use the full logo for primary brand signifiers (hero, header, key brand placements) and the icon for compact contexts like favicons, social avatars or tight UI spots.

## 4. Typography
*   **Headings**: Plantin MT Pro (Serif). Elegant and readable; perfect for headings, subheadings and other important text elements.
*   **Body**: Work Sans (Sans-serif). Clean, modern and versatile; well-suited for body text, captions and general-purpose text.

## 5. Voice and Tone
*   **Luxurious yet Warm**: Speak in a refined yet welcoming voice that feels luxurious, thoughtful and quietly confident, never loud or gimmicky.
*   **Anticipatory Service**: Emphasize the idea that “they’ve thought of everything” by highlighting anticipatory service, considered details and stress-free guest experiences.
*   **Serene & Nature-Inspired**: Use language that evokes the natural tranquility of the lake—calm, serene, timeless—while anchoring it in concrete, luxurious amenities and experiences.
*   **Aspirational**: Headlines should be aspirational and emotional (“Settle for… the Extraordinary”) while CTAs remain clear, inviting and not pushy.
*   **Authentic & Humble**: Copy should reflect authenticity and humility, expressing gratitude for guests and community and an eagerness to serve.
*   **Honest**: Reinforce integrity by describing offerings realistically and clearly, avoiding overblown promises or hype.
